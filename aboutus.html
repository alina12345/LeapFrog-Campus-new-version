                      <p>In 2006 AD Leapfrog Campus was established as an Engineering College under the affiliation of 
                          Tribhuwan university in the premises of Kupondole, Lalitpur. The initiation of establishing
                          this college was taken by Mr. Himal Karmacharya. We started with 70 students (20 students each
                          in BE Civil, BE Computer and BE Electrical & Electronics). Today thousands of students compete in the entrance exam
                          for 300 seats in each faculties (BE Civil, BE Computer, BArc, BE Electronics and BE IT). We
                          were overwhelmed when our college won the Best Engineering College Award 2012 given by Ministry
                          of Education last year. Till now three batch of students 
                          have graduated from here, which totals to One Hundred and Twenty Engineers. We are proud that 
                          since 2009 we are in the top of the list of Best Engineering Colleges of Nepal.</p>
